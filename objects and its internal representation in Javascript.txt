
objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 

These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) 

in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each depending on their types.

      Eg. If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc and methods like updateAddress, update Name, etc.
