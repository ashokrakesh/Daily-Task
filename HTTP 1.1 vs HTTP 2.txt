HTTP - 

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.

By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. 

HTTP/1.1 was created in 1997 and HTTP/2 was created in 2015.

HTTP 1.1 -It works on the textual format.

          There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources
 
          It compresses data by itself.	

HTTP/2

          It works on the binary protocol.

          It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

          It uses HPACK for data compression.
